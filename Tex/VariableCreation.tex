\section{Variable Ideas}

\subsection{General Customer Info}
\begin{itemize}
\item Whether the customer purchases online or not (binary 0-1)
\item Proportion of purchases customer makes online ($p \in [0,1]$ )
\item Customer online transaction count for each industry name (discrete, numeric) -- might purchase shoes online but not gasoline or groceries.
\item Customer transaction count for each industry name (discrete, numeric) -- might not have a car and not need to purchase gas.
\item Total transactions  (discrete, numeric)  \ac{Important as Build data sets only contain high frequency users}.
\item Home zip code (character) (also used for customer-merchant specifics).
\item Shopping zip codes (list - character) (zip codes where brick-and-mortar purchases are made).
\item Transactions in last XX months (discrete, numeric) (identify inactive cards/users)
\item Seasonality Holiday indicators and/or holiday intervals as we are graded on July - August
\item whether they shop at one zipcode only ( maybe 2-3 neighboring zipcode). (this can be used to cluster customers (mobility))
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Merchant Info - intermediate step}
\begin{itemize}
\item All info from merchant metrics \ac{it is not obvious to me how merchant metrics would be incorporated into a tree-like structure...}
\item Transactions in last XX months (discrete,numeric) (identify inactive cards/users)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Customer-Merchant Specifics}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Frequency of shopping at Merchant
\item Distance to merchant  from customer using zip centroids ( $\mathbb{R}_+$).
\item Mechant and customer zipcode match (0-1 binary)
\item Merchant and customer shopping zip code match (0-1 binary)
\item Shop at competitor (same industry)
\item shop at competitor in same zip (identify grocery, restaurant, gas patterns, potentially not likely to shop at competitor without coupon) \ac{Could also make a good story in the write-up, bill it as a way for merchants to identify their competition's customers and issue coupons to them}
\end{enumerate}
